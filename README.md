# Bamazon
Welcome to Bamazon, the best command line store in all the web.

Customer Mode:

This app utilizes Node.js, JavaScript and MySQL to enable users to place orders online via the command line.  The MySQL database keeps track of inventory so no product is oversold.
Users can select the products they want add them to their cart, and Bamazon does the rest.  The total before tax, sales tax, and total costs are all calculated and Bamazon's inventory
count is updated after every sale.


Manager mode:
Managers can login to the password protected edition of Bamazon to manage the store's inventory.  Users can check inventory levels of their products, update/replinish inventory counts, add
new products to their systems.

Spotlight Experieces:  
I was able to get good practice with MySQL databases and Node.js.
Good practice writing/implemeting callback functions.
"strict" JavaScript

Future development:
Rewrite code in C# and/or Python.
